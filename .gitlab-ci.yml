# GitLab CI template for Go tests. Note this installs
# a new working copy of Go (1.5.2 in this case) 
# in a non-standard path such that sudo/root is not 
# needed for the install stage.

# note that this particular install-environment stage
# is overly verbose in order to debug anything tricky
# or weird in your environment - feel free to trim it 
# down as needed

  - install-environment
  - build
  - test
