20150205 - Migrated from Bootstrap to Foundation, mainly to get rid of the baggage taken on since this Bootstrap theme was ported from a Jekyll theme originally...lots of excess
20150205 - Added an official changelog, but most other changes can be found in the github history ;)
20150207 - Replaced Negroni/Gorilla-Mux combination with Goji, which comes along with the handy (but difficult to grasp for me) web.Context feature, replacing my old GuardPath pseudo-middleware.
